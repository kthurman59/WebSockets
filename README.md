# WebSockets
Various websockets created to learn langs

This idea comes from The Primeagan, I think.  The streamer explained one of the best ways to learn a language, after learning syntax, is to create a WebSocket.  These are my attempts to augment my learning by using this means.  If you have anything to add please hit me up.  And if The Prime ever sees this, thank you for the advice!
